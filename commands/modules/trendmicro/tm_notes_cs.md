### Container Image Security

    - container image scanning, policy-based admission control, and container runtime protection
    - container admission control provides policy-based management of images and defines the rules for what containers can run in your environment
    - allows you to add security to your build pipeline by scanning new container images as theyâ€™re built and/or as they're published to a container registry
    - Container Runtime Protection is easily deployed in Kubernetes clusters on EKS, AKS, GKE from the Container Security console, and it allows you to enable runtime protection for all your containerized applications.  This runtime protection is deployed within the cluster and protects all containerized applications within each node.
